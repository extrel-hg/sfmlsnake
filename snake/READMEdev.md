# Vdev - Ddev - Hubert Gonera

## Welcome

Welcome to snake.
I have made this game to familiarize myself with SFML in C++, as well as managing a Github repo.

I am You know the premise of this game, but in the extremely unlikely event that you do not, here is a rundown:
* You are a snake.
* You want to grow, till you fill the whole map.
* The only way you can grow, is by eating fruit.

## Controls:

Right arrow to set direction to the right. Left to set to the left, etc.

If you hit a wall, or yourself, you lose.

In the main menu you can also use SPACE or ENTER to start a game, or Q to quit.

## Update notes:

**Patches:**
* Small changes to README, as well as project architecture.

## Versioning:

Version format: COMPATIBILITY.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

* COMPATIBILITY - Wheter or not this version savefiles etc. will work with another version. Some parts may still work with previous versions.
* MAJOR - Incermented if added new feature systems, heavily reworked existing ones, or added large features.
* MINOR - Incremented if added small to medium features in existing systems, or if they were reworked slightly. NOT INCREMENTED if new feature systems were added. Then MAJOR is incremented.
* PATCH - No new features, just bug fixes.

Each README has its build version in the beginning, and build date in dd/mm/yyyy.

## Building the game yourself

### SFML
This version was made using SFML 2.6.1 for VS2022 32-bit.

Remember to download it and link it properly to your IDE.

The game uses dynamic linking, and the requiered .dll files are already in the repo.

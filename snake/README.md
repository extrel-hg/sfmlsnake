# V1.0.2.0 - 13.10.2024 - Hubert Gonera

## Welcome

Welcome to snake.
This is a simple game. You need to get the biggest snake possible, by eating fruit.

## Controls:

Right arrow to set direction to the right. Left to set to the left, etc.

If you hit a wall, or yourself, the game closes. Sorry.

## Update notes:

**Minor:**
* Reworked the speed function. It is now not incremental, but instead follows something akin to a very flattened parabola.
* Moved from .txt README format over to .mb. Changed the versioning section a bit, as well as moved previous patchnotes to the current standard.

**Patches:**
* Added seed randomization for varying the location of fruit between runs. Previously, the fruit spawned in consistant locations in each run.

## Versioning:

Version format: COMPATIBILITY.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

* COMPATIBILITY - Wheter or not this version savefiles etc. will work with another version. Some parts may still work with previous versions.
* MAJOR - Incermented if added new feature systems, heavily reworked existing ones, or added large features.
* MINOR - Incremented if added small to medium features in existing systems, or if they were reworked slightly. NOT INCREMENTED if new feature systems were added. Then MAJOR is incremented.
* PATCH - No new features, just bug fixes.

Each README has its build version in the beginning, and build date in dd/mm/yyyy.
